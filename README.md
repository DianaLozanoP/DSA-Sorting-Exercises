## **bubbleSort**

Implement a function called bubbleSort. Given an array, bubbleSort will sort the values in the array.

Bubble sort is an O(n^2) algorithm. You can learn about [Bubble Sort](https://lessons.springboard.com/26ea17f3cc0242cd8e1bbfb2f08ce5ed?pvs=21)

```jsx
bubbleSort([4, 20, 12, 10, 7, 9]); // [4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 20]
bubbleSort([0, -10, 7, 4]); // [-10, 0, 4, 7]
bubbleSort([1, 2, 3]); // [1, 2, 3]
bubbleSort([]);

let nums = [
    4, 3, 5, 3, 43, 232, 4, 34, 232, 32, 4, 35, 34,
    23, 2, 453, 546, 75, 67, 4342, 32
];

bubbleSort(nums); // [2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 23, 32, 32, 34, 34, 35, 43, 67,
                  // 75, 232, 232, 453, 546, 4342]
```

## **merge**

Given two sorted arrays, write a function called merge which accepts two *sorted* arrays and returns a new array with values from both arrays sorted.

This function should run in O(n + m) time and O(n + m) space and should not modify the parameters passed to it.

Also, do not use the built in ***.sort()*** method! We’re going to use this function to implement a sort, so the helper itself shouldn’t depend on a sort.

```jsx
let arr1 = [1,3,4,5];
let arr2 = [2,4,6,8];
merge(arr1,arr2) // [1,2,3,4,4,5,6,8]

arr1 // [1,3,4,5];
arr2 // [2,4,6,8];

let arr3 = [-2,-1,0,4,5,6];
let arr4 = [-3,-2,-1,2,3,5,7,8];

merge(arr3,arr4); // [-3,-2,-2,-1,-1,0,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]

let arr5 = [3,4,5]
let arr6 = [1,2]

merge(arr5,arr6) // [1,2,3,4,5]
```

## **mergeSort**

Implement the merge sort algorithm. Given an array, this algorithm will sort the values in the array. Here’s some guidance for how merge sort should work:

- Break up the array into halves until you can compare one value with another
- Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those with other sorted pairs until you are back at the full length of the array
- Once the array is merged back together, return the merged (and sorted!) array
- In order to implement this function, you’ll also need to implement a merge function that takes in two sorted arrays and returns a new sorted array. You implemented this function in the previous exercise, so use that function!
